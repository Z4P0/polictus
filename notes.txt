TODO
----------------------------
- set up a dev environment that won't affect the 'working' live version
	http://dev.polict.us
- so what's the site for?
	what's it offer?
- find a better way to implement the content we're generating dynamically
	right now it's a bunch of lines creating elements
	it works but kinda makes it a pain to write out/edit/debug


BUGS
----------------------------
- info from wikipedia is still wonky


FEATURE IDEAS
----------------------------
- submit your email to receive updates based on your interests/issues
- select interests/issues that you want to be notified about
- notifications will be sent when there is a bill introduced that might affect your interests (drug war, internet freedom [cispa], gay marriage, gun control)
- reports on what your representatives did (weekly, monthly, daily)
- during election time view a summary on their voting record (be able to see if the representative agrees with their views)
- can we do IP sniffing to determine where the user might be without having to use html5 geolocation?

The Polictus Object
===================================
polictus = {
	citizen : {
		name : "patriot",
		district : "25", // if this isn't known we show the start up screen
		email : "email@address.com",
		interests : [
			// used to notify users of bills that might affect them
			// + highlight bills/vote that they care about
		]
	},
	representatives : [
		// this would get populated on startup
		{
			name: "some thing",
			[all sunlight info],
			bio : "[wikipedia text]",
			picture : "[url from wikipedia]"
			[all other API info we get]
		},
		{
			name: "other senator",
			[all other info]
		}
	],
	reader : 0
}
===================================



start:
	is there a polictus object stored locally?
		√ yes
			√ parse it
			build gui
		√ no:
			√ determine which representatives to show [html5 geolocation]
				√ if they don't want to share their location
				√ or want to search a different location:
					√ address geolocation [google]

			√ build polictus object
			make API calls
				√ sunlight
				√ wikipedia

			show:
				√ basic info on their reps. [sunlight]
				√ short bio/picture 				[wikipedia]
				voting history 						[govtrack]
				influences 								[influenceexplorer]

Unique ID: The bioguide_id will be present and unique for all members of Congress. It is an official ID, assigned by Congress, and is the most suitable for use as a unique ID.

_polictus = new app.polictus.Polictus(results[0].geometry.location.kb,results[0].geometry.location.jb);
// }_polictus = new app.polictus.Polictus(results[0].geometry.location.kb,results[0].geometry.location.lb);
// ^ google changed a letter that broke everything lawl.............. ^
also, the values had to be switched around
we were passing in latitude as longitude and vice versa

- if geolocation is denied by browser, address form does not show
	we hide the original 'address_form' via CSS so that it can be toggled into view via JS
	this was hiding the subsequent 'address_form' when the user denied using HTML5 geolocation
	the fix:
		adding the style inline when we create the element dynamically
		div.style.display = 'block';
