1. get geocoding to work



eventually...

polictus = {
	citizen : {
		name : "patriot",
		district : "25", // if this isn't known we show the start up screen
		email : "email@address.com",
		interests : [
			// used to notify users of bills that might affect them
			// + highlight bills/vote that they care about
		]
	},
	representatives : [
		// this would get populated on startup
		{
			name: "some thing",
			[all sunlight info],
			bio : "[wikipedia text]",
			picture : "[url from wikipedia]"
			[all other API info we get]
		},
		{
			name: "other senator",
			[all other info]
		}
	]
}








get the wiki page for each rep.
	save each response as a string to a 
get the img from there
and summary
just the raw txt/URL

--
deal with nicknames (might be tough)

use localStorage to store wiki info (save api calls)

Wikipedia


===================================
first time messing with wikipedia
they're api isn't what you expect.
i expected to be able to make calls for specific content from pages
maybe something like
title=Kirsten_Gillibrand|Chuck_Schumer/summary|main_image

most of the time i hate other people's mark-up. idk why i think mine is any better but when requesting info i want it in it's rawest, purest form. just straight text (that i can access via something reasonable and easily parasble) so that i can add markup how i want it






start:
	is there a polictus object stored locally?
	yes
		parse it
		build gui
	no:
		determine which representatives to show [html5 geolocation]
			if they don't want to share their location
			or want to search a different location:
				address geolocation [google]

		make API calls
		build polictus object

		show:
			basic info on their reps. [sunlight]
			short bio/picture 				[wikipedia]
			voting history 						[govtrack]
			influences 								[influenceexplorer]














dope:
	bill information:
	http://www.govtrack.us/developers/api
	plotical players:
	http://data.influenceexplorer.com/api/aggregates/contributions/?r



idea:
	submit your email
	select some basic interests
		- email notifications will be sent when there is a bill introduced that might affect your interests
		(drug war, internet freedom [cispa], gay marriage, gun control)
		via: govtrack? (y)
