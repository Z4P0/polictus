Wikipedia


===================================
first time messing with wikipedia
they're api isn't what you expect.
i expected to be able to make calls for specific content from pages
maybe something like
title=Kirsten_Gillibrand|Chuck_Schumer/summary|main_image

most of the time i hate other people's mark-up. idk why i think mine is any better but when requesting info i want it in it's rawest, purest form. just straight text (that i can access via something reasonable and easily parasble) so that i can add markup how i want it






start:
	is there a polictus object stored locally?
		√ yes
			parse it
			build gui
		√ no:
			√ determine which representatives to show [html5 geolocation]
				√ if they don't want to share their location
				√ or want to search a different location:
					√ address geolocation [google]

			√ build polictus object
			make API calls
				√ sunlight
				√ wikipedia

			show:
				basic info on their reps. [sunlight]
				short bio/picture 				[wikipedia]
				voting history 						[govtrack]
				influences 								[influenceexplorer]














dope:
	bill information:
	http://www.govtrack.us/developers/api
	plotical players:
	http://data.influenceexplorer.com/api/aggregates/contributions/?r



idea:
	submit your email
	select some basic interests
		- email notifications will be sent when there is a bill introduced that might affect your interests
		(drug war, internet freedom [cispa], gay marriage, gun control)
		via: govtrack? (y)
