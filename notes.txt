Wikipedia


===================================
first time messing with wikipedia
they're api isn't what you expect.
i expected to be able to make calls for specific content from pages
maybe something like
title=Kirsten_Gillibrand|Chuck_Schumer/summary|main_image







start:
	is there a polictus object stored locally?
		√ yes
			parse it
			build gui
		√ no:
			√ determine which representatives to show [html5 geolocation]
				√ if they don't want to share their location
				√ or want to search a different location:
					√ address geolocation [google]

			√ build polictus object
			make API calls
				√ sunlight
				√ wikipedia

			show:
				√ basic info on their reps. [sunlight]
				√ short bio/picture 				[wikipedia]
				voting history 						[govtrack]
				influences 								[influenceexplorer]














dope:
	bill information:
	http://www.govtrack.us/developers/api
	plotical players:
	http://data.influenceexplorer.com/api/aggregates/contributions/?r



idea:
	submit your email
	select some basic interests
		- email notifications will be sent when there is a bill introduced that might affect your interests
		(drug war, internet freedom [cispa], gay marriage, gun control)
		via: govtrack? (y)






Unique ID: The bioguide_id will be present and unique for all members of Congress. It is an official ID, assigned by Congress, and is the most suitable for use as a unique ID.


+ add classes to reprepsentative <dl>s
	dl class="fields"
	dl class="contact"
	dl class="social_media"


- sometimes the wrong wiki info is shown for the representative
- showing 'null' in strings
	ex. Dianne null Feinstein
